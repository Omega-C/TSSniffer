# TSSniffer
a python program I made to make it super easy to check packet ip location with tshark.

Not the most original but I thought it was a great spent one and a half day project.

follow the tutorial and install all avalible resources -> [here](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html).

you may need to look up display filters for wireshark and tshark to fully use it.
